<br><br>

## Engine

You need [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/) to compile and build the project.
<br><br>

## Before you go...

Code quality is not great at this version. I prioritized releasing working versions over code quality. There are some changes I made to improve but you won't see it in this release. I'll slowly try to reflect those changes into this repository as well. Until then, you're on your own :)
